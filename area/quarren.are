it is just a strong current.

Desc     The domed city of Heurkea is divided into three main streets. Each having
distinct and differnt purposes. It was designed for easy access and so
that security could patrol and maintain order. One of the best Security
features of Heurkea is that there are only three roads to hide on and they
all lead to only to exits The streets are made out of the old molten rock
ocean floor that used to be here covered with water. They have managed to
adapt a plant that uses very little to grow down here although the leaves
are a pale white. Lining the walls of the street are small shacks the
miners use for domicles. To the North is a large white structure with
statues of great Quarren fighters framing the main steps.

underwater seems to go on forever. Of coarse there isn't a sun rise or set
so time has very little relevince. Most of the people wake up and go
whenever they feel like it, Unfortunately so do the shop owners. In front
of you is a small clothing tent that can be uplifted and moved at a

most of the miners. There is a large sign and a small note fixed to the

ExDesc       Although scientists swear the extinction of the krebbex was long ago. A few
Quarren swear to it's exisitence. These  extinct ten-legged crustaceans
once lived in the great Mon ocean. But according to one witness, Witho
Tokio just recently when she was staring out of the north dome edge she
saw it in the merky waters above. City officials stated there was anything
that big in the ocean the sensors would have picked it up a long time ago.
 But Witho is not alone, over 28 diffrent sitings have come up in the past
year. And several Quarren miners have not returned and are listed as
missing(with no explination). A few Quarren residents fear the worst and
have refused to leave the city. Although most think of it as a cute story.

ExDesc       Ackbar was later rescued from slavery by an Alliance force and named
Admiral of the Rebel fleet. Six years after the Battle of Endor, the
reborn Emperor used his World Devastators to attack Calamari's
southern;territorial zone, destroying most of the city of Kee-Piru. The
port city;of Hikahi was also;damaged, harming the planet's
starship-building capability. One year after that, Leia Organa Solo
visited Admiral Ackbar at his home in the seatree forest in an attempt to
bring him out of his self-imposed exile. A subsequent attack by Admiral
Daala's Star Destroyers resulted in the destruction of Reef Home City.

ExDesc       The Mon Calamari had already constructed enormous starships and begun
traveling space when their planet was discovered by the Empire. The
Imperials planned to enslave Calamari and, after meeting with resistance
from its natives, destroyed three of its floating cities. A Quarren,
Seggor Tels, is believed to have deliberately lowered Calamari's
defenses;to allow the Empire's attack this has heightened tensions between
the Mon Calamari and the Quarren ever since. After the Empire showed its
true colors, Calamarian starships were converted into warships and the
shipbuilding docks in orbit around Calamari and its single moon became an
important resource for the Alliance. Many Calamarians were taken as slaves
by the Empire including the famous Ackbar, who was forced to be the
personal servant of Grand Moff Tarkin.  To see the next page type look

ExDesc       Calamari (sometimes called Mons Calamari) is a tectonically stable world
almost entirely covered with water, and is home to both the peaceful Mon
Calamari and the cautious Quarren-- over 27 billion inhabitants in all.
The surface of the planet is covered with small marshy islands and
enormous floating cities that house both species, with the Quarren
inhabiting the lowest, darkest levels. These attractive constructions
include Reef Home, Coral Depths, Kee-Piru, Coral City, and Foamwander
City. The architecture and design of the Mon Calamari have organic
appearances, with rounded edges and irregular surfaces that show their
love for the natural beauty of their world. Raw ores used in construction
are mined by the Quarren (who can breathe both air and;water) from domed
cities on the ocean floor. To see the next page type look history2

ExDesc       The Ultima-Pearl is the greatest treasure Mon Calmarians have to offer.
Only three have ever surfaced from the cold dark ocean. According to the
legend by the bi-valve mollusks, there is only one place the Ultima-Pearl
will be created. Fearing that the prize would be piliged from the ocean
for good. The mollusks controled the currents so that noone can find the
location. They also control a sharklike creature called  krakanas, which
have now been know as the guardian of the pearl. Fearing the increase of
smugglers in town city officials agreed to declare the pearl, offlimits.
failure to follow this ruling results in you being wanted on the planet.

ExDescKey    handbook~
ExDesc       How to mine! So you want to mine ah? Well first let me tell you a bit about
mining. The iron ore occurs in near - vertical fissures or lodes, ranging
from a few inches to a few feet wide. Generally though, the productive
lodes were about a foot wide. Shallow pits were dug to prove the locations
of the lodes. Once found, adits were driven into the hillside following
the lode. The ore is very soft and the miners would first rake out all the
material in sight from the lode above them, generally for two metres or so
- a method known as `hulking'. We prefer to use our ore carriers to carry
most of the ore as it allows us to enter further into the mine.
To read on look mine2

#ENDEXDESC

#EXDESC
ExDescKey    mine2~
ExDesc       The miners blasted to create the mines, using mining droids to create the
arched passageways that were braced with timers as in this picture. In
order to blast the mountain, holes were drilled into the mountain and
charges were placed within these holes. The charges in the center were
blasted out first and then the charges around this center hole were
blasted out until the large hole was blasted out.;Miners used ore carriers
to go up and down to the depths of the mine. New miners, called "muckers",
are teased (usually by being;tickled) in these Carriers.
So you think you've heard enough background? type look mine3

ExDescKey    mine3~
ExDesc       To begin here you must get a security id and password form the local mine
shop boss. This becomes rather tricky, since most Quarren work them, and
it takes a little extra to sweaten the secretary to let you in to see the
boss .  Once you enter the mine you can check out a shovel or pick (your
preference) and a ore carrier (if one is available) and go to work.
Digging random works the best. When you have finished a jobs work stop by
the cargo haul and get paid. Payment is based on amount dug.   You are
free to stop and work at anytime, just understand the ore dealer is only
there for four hours.
