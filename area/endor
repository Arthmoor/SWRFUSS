Desc     You stand in the middle of a room filled with little ewok children they
range  in size from very tiny and crawling on fur blankets to the near
adolecents playing with toy bows arrows and spears. The room is littered
with an abundant amount of  toys for the children to play with. Its a
rather room for ewok standards and has been put to use from what you can
guess to be a very very long time. There are few females here tending to
the young as well as the cries of the new born infants.

Desc     The walkway is made from some very sturdy planks of wood that seem to
be able to withstand alot of weight as well as alot of the pressure
the forest elements have (and can) throw at it. The ewoks very rarely
get visitors to their village, so quite naturaly they are a little 
cautious when it comes to new people here, but they do eventualy 
accept your presence and let you in on the village celebrations.
The walkways are very high up from the ground, this is due to the
carnivors that inhabit the planet with the ewok people. The most feared
beast is the humanoid behemoth Gorax, who are the main reason for the 
village being so high off the ground.

Desc     The walkway is made from very sturdy planks of wood that seem to
be able to withstand alot of weight as well as alot of pressure
the forest elements have (and can) throw at it. The ewoks very rarely
get visitors to their villages, so quite naturaly they are a little
cautious when it comes to new people here, but they do eventually
accept your presence and let you in on the village celebrations.
The walkways are very high up from the ground, this is due to the
beast is the humanoid behemoth Gorax, who are the main reson for the 
village being so high up in the Endor Trees.
