Name     Dagobah Area~
Sector   inside~
Desc     The planet Dagobah -- who named it and why, is told in no existing
record. Dagobah itself seems to avoid mention, as if some invisible power
deflects all inquiries. As a result, the swampy planet is cloaked in
mystery.
   For non-Jedi Knight classes, players will be able to travel in Dagobah
and explore its peculiar swampy terrain, fight slug beasts, and the like,
but for Jedi Knights, this is where they must go in order to find the
lightsaber they need to be true Jedi.

so they can swim underwater and fix the spacecraft.

Desc     You stand up to your knees in fowl-smelling muck, comprised of rotten
leaves and other smells you don't want to know the source of. Your ruined
craft suddenly belches air from under the wing and begins to sink slowly
into the Dagobah Swamp. Before you can act, the craft's nose suddenly rears
back and the entire body of the ship sinks beneath the muck.
   Well, it seems you're going to be stuck here for a while. It seems 
impassable all around you except the far end of the swamp to the north, 
where a path seems to wind its way into the trees.

Desc     Dense vegetation, heavy moisture, and thick fog are all good
descriptions of your surroundings.  Sounds of strange creatures
beakoning to you to venture into the wild fill your ears.  The ground
below you begs to differ.  It seems quite difficult to make your way 
through this rough terrain.  It is almost as though you can feel a 
hundred pairs of eyes watching your every movement.  Despite this,
you feel an odd sense of calm and serenity.  Almost as though you are
at one with yourself.  There is an odd feeling to this whole planet.

Sector   inside~
Desc     The swampy surroundings seem to enclose around you in an ominous
manner.  Large trees with vines hanging from them surround you.
Vines from the trees lay at your feet, entangled in the brush all
about.  No sunlight seems to penetrate through the thick vegetation.
All the moisture around you combining with the tremendous heat rising
through the ground has created some rather thick fog.  You can feel
a surplus of eyes studying your every move and watching for flaws or
mistakes.  The force is strong here but, that does not mean it is a
safe place for all living creatures.  Quite the contrary, this swamp
is a vile and unsafe place for anyone not perfectly aligned with the
force.  Only the brave or fool-hardy dare walk these paths alone.
To the east and west the path is much too thick and dense.  It is
impossible to continue in either direction.  You would need some 
kind of device to chop down trees and cut through weeds.  To the north
and south a thin narrow path exists.  You will be able to make your
way through the brush with sime effort.

drips all around you.  Sounds of the dripping water echo through
out the cavernous halls.  It is very dark in here, virtually no
light manages to break through and illuminate your surroundings.
To the south is a small secluded exit that leads to the a portion
of boggy marsh.  To the west the cave continues.  Watch your step
if you can.  One false step in here could cost you your life in a
rather permenent manner.  The sloppy and reckless shall perish where
as the cautious, calm and passive shall succeed.

above you.  The soft sound of dripping water can be heard in the
distance.  High above you many pairs of glowing red eyes stare at
you.  The eyes do not seem menacing but, rather judgemental.  Your
every action, movement, and reaction is closely watched.  The floor
beneath you is suprisiningly dry.  The floor is dry powdery dirt.
You feel an odd ominous presence.  The force is strong in here.

It is quite dark here.  The dirt floor below you seems soft and 
forgiving.  The walls offer a sharp contrast to this.  The walls
are solid rock and very jagged.  A penetrating fog nearly blinds you.
A soft light comes from an unlocatable source.  Your vision is
impaired, reality is questionable at this point.  Do you trust your
senses?  Is everything whay it seems?  Proceed with caution.  Your
every action carries mountianous weight and mistakes can be costly
if not fatal.  To the south the cavern continues.

to arise.  Careful, passive and calm are the ways of the jedimaster.
Anger, fear and aggression lead to evil.  That is not the way to
become a jedimaster.  The force is strong here, you have a strange
feeling that you are not alone.

as high as you can see.  Which is not all that far.  A thick
cover of fog blankets the tree tops and sinks down on you.  Many
vines hang from the trees.  The path is difficult to follow.
You can not even be sure that this actually is a path.  It just
happens to be wide enough for you to squeak through.  Be careful
and watch your step, danger surrounds you.

Desc     Each step is quite difficult under these circustances.  You nearly
fall over into trees and other sources of brush with each step.
A thick fog drops moisture down on you.  The chilled air feels 
refreshing in what is an otherwise hot swampland.  Dagobah may be
completely devoid of technology and even civilization for that matter
but, the planet certainly does not lack in living creatures.
Creatures long since believed to be extinct thrive in these swampy
surroundings.  Creatures undiscovered by most of the galaxy have
made a nice little niche for themselves here.

Desc     Thick brush grows up all around you.  The weeds, vines, and moisture
all contribute to difficult travel.  Dagobah is quite strong with the
force.  You can feel the force all about you, it seems to be what holds
this place together.  It binds it all together.  The ground beneath you
is soggy from an eminence surplus of moisture.  Adding to the 
frustration of the difficult terrian is the fact that one section of
swamp looks almost identical to any other section of swamp.  The fog
hangs low overhead, no sun is visible.  There do not seem to be any
natural landmarkers to go by.  It would be rather easy to get lost in
here and never find your way out.  Being Forced to sleep out here does
not sound all that fun either.  Creatures of every manner and species
lurk about in the shadows and hidden deep within the fog.

Desc     Dreams and nightmares feed off places like this.  It is definitely
an eerie locale.  Dagobah is not known for its supercilious technology.
This place is as civilized as attending an organized cherfer fight.
The only difference is you are at risk here rather than some poor, dumb
cherfer.  It is not such a good feeling.  You can feel hundreds of
peering, beedy little eyes staring at you.  The sounds and calls of
creatures all about you echo through the tree tops.  The force is
strong here.  The entire planet reaks of the stuff.  Even the
small little animals eminate a powerful aura.  Dagobah is held
together by the force, it pulls, strengthens, and binds an otherwise
uncivilized and mostly unintelligent planet.  The sun is completely
blocked out by the incredibly tall and thick trees.
