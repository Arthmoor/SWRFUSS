type PRACTICE <full name of power, skill or weapon style>.

For instance, to practice dual wield, you would type PRAC DUAL WIELD.
When practicing, you start at 0% and one practice will earn you between

the skill or spell until adept, which is a maximum of 30% - 95%.

type HELP PRACTICE.  The number of practice sessions you may gain at each
level is determined by the amount of wisdom you have when you level.

Some are very hard to find, as the clues could be rooms away. However, you
are now armed with the tools to locate them. You know how to use "look", 
bump, and "exit". Many classes also get a spell called "scry". This spell
will allow the person affected by it to see the into the adjoining rooms.
It is used like "look", but gives you more detailed information. To see if
you gain the scry spell at a later level, type SLIST. This will give you a
list of all spells, skills and weapon types you may practice. Slist also

You have experienced open exits and closed doors to this point. There are

Often they will not show up with the "look" method either. These exits are
found by reading room descriptions, mobiles descriptions and looking at
objects. You are looking for words that stand out, those words will be the
door name. You will also find doors that are locked. You may get past some
locked doors with the pass door spell, the pick door skill or bash door skill.
Some doors may only be passed by using the matching key. Other exits you

Desc     This room explains about WIMPY, FLEE, and RECALL as a way to leave from
combat. Wimpy is an automatic withdrawal from a fight when your hitpoints
reach a set minimum. To set your wimpy, type WIMPY or WIMPY <number>. The
number being the amount of hitpoints you want remaining when you leave the
battle. You will lose experience for wimpying out of a fight, but the amount
of experience lost will generally be less then the amount lost from death.
You may also manually withdraw from a fight with flee. To use flee, just
type FLEE. You may flee out of the fight at any amount of hitpoints. Fleeing
will cost you loss of experience. You may also "recall" from a fight. This
is done with the spell "word of recall" or reciting a recall scroll. You 
lose more experience when you recall from a fight then when you use wimpy
or flee. Recall should be used as a last resort.

Sector   city~
Flags    nomob indoors prototype~
Desc     A very important thing to learn about early is cloning. Death is permanent.
When you die you loose everything. However... somewhere deep in the core
worlds is a place that creates and stores the clones of those who are
willing to pay a small fee. Having a clone makes a back up of your
character at the moment of cloning that can be used in the event of an
untimely death. My advice is to find the cloning facilities as soon as
possible and make a new clone at least every five levels. Death is a lot
less painful when you loose 5 levels as opposed to having to start over
from the beginning.
