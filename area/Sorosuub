Desc     An upgrade on the old z-95's the z-100 or  century fighter  as it is
betterknown, is alot more powerfull than it elder counterpart. It is
basically  a cross of the older z-95 and Incoms X-wings making it a
versitile fighter. Four forward  firing lasers combined with its torpedo
launcher make it quite a powerfull fighter and it's compact size makes it
easy to stow in the hangers of larger capital ships
