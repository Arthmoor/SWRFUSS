Inside a Sparti Cloning Cylinder~
You wake up as if from a long sleep. Slowly your mind begins to fill with
the memories of a life you never lived. At first they are distant
memories. Foreign, unattached, but slowly their intensity increases
overwhelming you with emotions from a life you never lived. Pain. Love.
Sorrow. Joy. Tears swell up in your eyes as you begin to sob, overwhelemed
by you existance and saddened by the love of a life you never lived.   
 
Take a few moments to collect your thoughts. Then "leave" the cylinder and
begin a new life.
 
* Don't forget... the first thing you should do is go clone yourself
again... you might regret it if you don't...

In a Small Sterile Room~
This small room smells of strongly of antiseptic. There is a large flat
bench which is covered in removeable tissue. You assume that this is where
blood and tissues samples are taken as well as where new clones are
examined. There are several medical insterments lining the walls. Some you
can't even imagine what the might be used for.

Excercise Room~
This room is filled with various excercise equipment used to help young
clones get into shape as they first begin using their bodies after a long
gestation and an accelerated growth period. All of the equipment has gages
to monitor the progress and vital signs of the clones.

Rest Area~
This area of the comlex is set up as a small lounge. There are several
couches and chairs scattered about the room along with a few low tables. A
curtain at the back of the room hides a few cots to rest in. 
 
You may quit and reenter the game from here.

The cloning Facilities~
The visible part of this building is small and bunker like but there must
be much more too it below ground - cloning takes alot of energy. The
owners of this establishment have salvaged a couple of sparty cloning
cylinders that were left over from the clone wars and have turned them
into a small but very profitable business. They make money cloning people
who believe that if their body lives on after their death than so do they.

The Cloning Chamber~
This large room contains contains the tops of some cloning cylinders but
from what you have heard there must be more to them bellow this level.
Aside from the cylinders which have many pipes and wires leading from them
this room is empty. There seems to be no way into the cylinders other than
going back and standing in line.
