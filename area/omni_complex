Desc     The Isolation Chamber is a dreary place.  There is a soft, diffuse light
and soft grey walls.  It would be almost relaxing if it weren't so mind-
numbingly boring.  If you have to stay in here much longer, you are sure
to lose your sanity.

hurts your eyes to look at it for more than a few seconds.
Several metal folding chairs seem to be holding the walls up.

Desc     You stop short, just inside the room, and look around in astonishment.
The walls and domed ceiling are covered with flat paintings and
planics, a few of them vaguely human-looking but most of distinct
alien origin. Various sculptures are scattered around, some
freestanding, others on pedestals. In the center of the room is a
double circle of repeater displays, the outer ring  slightly higher
than the inner ring. Both sets of displays, at from what little you
can see, also seems to be devoted to pictures of artwork. And in the
center of the double circle is a duplicate of an Admirals chair that
would normaly be found on the ships bridge
