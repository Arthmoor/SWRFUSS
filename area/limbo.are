Desc     You stand in the direct center of the Arena.  Blood pools around your
feet, and you almost slip in this morbid mess.  The stench of death
surrounds you, momentarily blocking from your mind the realization
that you could be attacked from any conceivable direction.  Spinning
slowly about, you realize the poor tactical position you hold.

chance at glory, honor, and spoils beyond the great doors.  The Arena is
dangerous, though, and battles are often to the death.  Once you leave
