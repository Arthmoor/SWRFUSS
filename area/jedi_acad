Desc     You're looking down another long stone corridor. Doors line the halls up
and down and peeking behind one you see a student quietly meditating on
their bed. This is where students who can afford to live on the grounds
stay. They are given one adequately sized room for 100,000 credits per
room, which is a bit pricey but worth it. At least you think. Maybe you
should consider taking out a loan. . .

Desc     You look around in Awe as you enter the Masters private quarters. They are
nothing like the rest of the temple in that, the walls aren't the drab
stone like the rest of the temple, they're a nice bright white, the floors
are covered in lush velvet carpeting and the light fixtures are made from
rare krayt hide, so the light reflects in different colours from each
fixture, there is a small table in the center of the room with a small
holodisc in the center to recieve messages from people who can't make it
here in person, there are also a repulsorcouch and a holo-vid unit here as
well as other very fancy furniture, to the west stairs lead down to the
kitchen area but to the east is the masters sleeping quarters which are
very much off limits to all students. I'm sure he won't mind you looking
around, just a little bit. .

kitchen, where two droids go back and forth cleaning dishes and doing
other things, a box in the wall leads down to the kitchen, where food is
sent up for the master while another in the floor is specifically for
garbage, like the rest of the house, the kitchen is sparkling clean and
you want to just take your shoes off and squish your toes in the soft
batha hide rug there are a few doors here which lead to the bathroom and
closet. Taking a deep breath you never want to leave this place

all the way to the back, there is a long dark blue carpet running down the
center of the room from the turbo lift to a podium at the other end of the
large hall pillars line the sides of the room and look like they would
become quite a maze if you wandered to far into them, upon closer
inspection you notice they are made of the finest marble, with strange
symbols carved into them. Your final deduction is that this magnificant,
yet simply decorated room is where new Jedi's are inducted or promoted
within the order.
