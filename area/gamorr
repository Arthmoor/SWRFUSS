Desc     This is the cave of the mountain clans matron. It seems to be a little
messed up, there is what looks like would be the nest of a gurda on
the floor, could it be the she owns the gurda?, it would make sense
since only the matron is allowd to have childern and no other female
can because the would defeat the purpose of haveing the social
structure the gamorreans have adopted as their own. You come to the
conclusion that the matron sent the gurda after the other females
child, to kill t or to bring it back, only the matron knows.

Desc     This is a nicely put together stand, as far as stands go, because
it is made from a rare wood not found anywhere on this planet
and it has been very well cut aswell as the designs cut into it
make it seem as though it has a little story scrolling across its 
edge. The stand has a nice odour to it, due to the variety of drinks
and snacks that are being sold to its patrons.

you can tell by the smell they dont take good care of their living
quarters, the smell of urine fills the air and burns your nose.
Though the smell of the forest you were travelling in had such a
sweet sent to it, the smell from these huts completly cancels out any
presence of the forest with surrounds the entire village.

small problem that it has left them open to unwanted visitors. From
the mine shaft in the ground you hear a viscious groweling and it
doesn't sound to pleasent to teh ears. You have heard of the Gurdas
that have been known to snatch the odd child from its cribs and now
it seems you are gonna witness one from a distance.

Sector   city~
Desc     The village is in chaos, there seems to be only one gamorrean with his
thoughts straight and the is the shammon to the south. The groweling
is still very  loud and promenent as still very viscious. Hear the
scream of a child as it sound as if it has been captured by a gurda.
You think and hope to yourself  that they dont hunt in packs cause
then this place could be surrounded by them.  the thought sends
shivers up and down you spine..

Desc     This is the home to the Gamorreans only known shammon, he has his
place in good order for a Gamorrean, and the smell isn't as bad as
you had the pleaseue of smelling in the main village. The Shammon has
an assortment of small trinkets lying around his abode everything
from small and large gems to the odd credit and you think you see a
hilt of some sort but, that would not be a surprise even for a
Gamorrean of his age.

Desc     The chaos and the groweling is getting worse as time goes on, you see
of blood comeing from the cave and going north and you also see a
babies little booty in the trail, seems like the panic has its
reasons, something has got a baby and it is most likely a gurda that
has it too. The mother is standing here screaming for her babies safe
return, she's looking at you as if you might be the only one who can
do it.
