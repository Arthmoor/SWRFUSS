standards, is of a squat looking alien creature. It is hunched over
slightly and stands with a cane. At the foot of the monument an
inscription drones on about this creatures deads. Not exactly exciting bed

Sector   city~
Desc     You stand along the western edge of Monument Plaza, the large mall built
around the peak of one of the Menari Mountains on Coruscant. Because of
its location it is one of the nicer areas of coruscant. A freesh breeze
and clean air are a refreshing change to the busy dirty streets. The
preimiter of the plaza is line with shops while the center of the plaza is
filled with enourmous monuments of old heroes.

Desc     You stand in the northwest corner of Monument Plaza. It sports some of the
largest statues in the Galaxy but the bigger attaction for the locals is
the fact that its one of the few places in Coruscant you can actually
touch bare rock in its natural state. A restaurant is to the north and
many shops are to the west and south of here.

Desc     You are standing in front of a rack of cheap clothing and clothing-
related merchandise.  Most of the items are inexpensive T-Shirts
plastered with ill-thought out slogans and repulsive logos.  A floating
droid which seems to be a modified remote shoots around over your head
making notes of all your purchases and charging you for them.  To the
north is a library of some kind and to the east is an exit.

Desc     The checkout counter is little more than a relic now, as people pay
as they go nowadays.  Each part of this souvenir shop specializes in
a different genre of gift.  To your immediate north are holo-images
of the Plaza from different angles, to the northwest are datadisks
containing stories about the statues that eternally dwell here.  To
the west is a small clothing section, with T-shirts bearing logos
such as "I saw Monument Plaza" and other equally unimaginative
phrases.

Desc     Here, in the small back corner of Heff's Souvenir shop, lies a largly
unorganised, but amazingly unique, collection of datatapes.  Each
tape , no more than two inches square, contains the sotry of one of the
statues in the Plaza.  Few shoppers notice this trove of treasure, and
fewer still stop to examine it.  There are tapes here from some of the
great authors of all time, spanned the centuries, even the eons in some
cases!  Surely the price charged here is but a fraction of the tapes'
true value.  To your south is a T-shirt stand and to the east is the
visuals section.
