is a landing zone for small vessels.  It would take a skilled
pilot in a ship he was well-acustomed to, to even attempt
landing in this narrow and dangerous area.  Anything larger than
a Z-95 HEADHUNTER or Tie Fighter would find it nearly
impossible to navigate into this region.  The point being made
here is this, it wouldn't appear that Imperials or Rebels have
seriously developed the landscape.  That means one of two things.
Either they have and their base is hidden or you are someplace

Unfortunately, living on a planet that is an active vocano has its
draw backs.  Worse than that, Adarians are deeply involved in the
mining industry.  So they have raped Adari of all its natural resources.
This could be a civilization on the downward spiral.  You can continue
