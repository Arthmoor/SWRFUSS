Desc       Brennik Torien is not the most attractive correlien you've ever seen
but he is by no means ugly either. His apearance does however suffer
somewhat from the dark bags under his eyes that suggest long hours of
work. He is slim and agile and moves quickly and gracefully between
customers. His voice is strong and caries well across the crowded bar
room yet is comforting at the same time. You feel that many people
would find it quite easy to talk of just about anything to this man.

Desc     You are on the main platform of the shipyard orbiting Coruscant. Because
it is an off planet shipyard, larger capital ships maybe built and launched
from here as well as the more standard planetary ones.
All of the ships in this part of the shipyard are ready for flight.
Many of them are owned by the new republic but there are often several
private ones docked here as well as some available to rent

furnishing here is a round counter and a few chairs. The counter is
large enough to house two  hotel clerks within its curvature quite
comfortably. At the end of the room two corridors stretch out around
the perimeter of the station. Hotel rooms  are located along these
corridors circling the entire commercial deck - tucked in behind the

panel, and an instrument glowlight that doesn't work anymore.  The
well-worn flight seat is a welcome comfort though: compared to newer
ship's firm, uncomfortable ones, it has obviously been worn down to a
comfortable level by use over hundreds of flight hours. Your external
view is partially blocked by the classic durasteel reinforcement
struts lining the sides of the front plastisteel view plate.  This
flaw, which has been remedied in newer ships, is one of the main
reasons the Y-Wing never became a popular snub fighter and was often
used as a bomber instead.

Desc     Welcome to the hub of pluogus activity. This room seems to always be
busy. THe main bar stretches across the back wall. A humaniod bar
keeper moves quickly from customer to customer with the efficiency
that only comes with years of experience. Behind him are shelves of
bottles in every conceivable shape color and size. Enough to keep
anyone busy for a very long voyage. The front of the bar is devoid of
chairs. But the rest of the room is quite full of them. In fact, the
ship designers seem to have given up the wide hallway aproach seen in
the rest of the vessle in favor of trying to cram in as many booths
as possible into this part of the ship.   Because of this a smaller
bar is installed next to the door offering a minimal selection of
drinks for those who don't wish to fight their way to the back.

the front lounge to a set of doors at the rear of the room.  The
corridor is flanked on each side by large cusions separated by thin
tables. Each table has a set of controlls for adjusting the height of
the table. This compartment was obviously made to accomedate some of
the larger passengers who would find it difficult to manuever around
other parts of the ship. There are no windows but small ceiling
mounted viewscreens can either be tuned to the ship mounted cameras
or to one of several galactic network channels.   A passenger
terminal is installed on one of the walls here for you to leave
comments to the management or leave general posts for the other
passengers. To the south a set of large doors leads to the ships
bathroom facilities.

Desc     You notice a strong antiseptic smell as you walk into this room. The
floor is smooth and has been recently cleaned and polished.  Th wall
opposite the entrance is furnished with several stalls of various
shapes and sizes. Each of them is an attempt to provide a comfortable
toilet for each of the more common travelling galactic races. Looking
from stall to stall you might find it amusing to see what some
species call toilets. On the door side of the room stretches a large
counter top from wall to wall. It is fitted with several sinks, spray
hoses and other disinfectant and deionizing devices. At the farthest
end of the room between the stalls and sinks are two large waste
disposal units. One is an incineration device for solids and the
other a disposable tank for combustable liquids such as the grease
used by some older model droids.

in an almost random fashion, each of them centerd around one of many
low tables. The furniture all apears quite comfortable and obviously
are designed for humaniod forms. The lighting is relatively dim but
directional lights by each table can be brightened to suit each

through the observation lounge. To the south is the sleeping

In an attempt to promote galactic trade and tourism, several large
corperations and planets teamed together to fund this completely free
tour bus. This room was a late add on to the Pluogus for those
passengers wishing for private sleeping quarters on long tours. The
large room   is sectioned off into enclosed bunks stacked along the
walls. There are several different sized chambers but most of them
seem designed to fit one or two humans comfortably. All the beds have
a somewhat soundproof door and are lockable from the inside.     
 
This would be a good place to rest for awhile. You may safely
leave and re-enter the game from here.

Desc     It is not a very wise thing to play in the airlock. A button on the wall is
used to decompress the airlock. If you push it it will most likely kill
you instantly. It would be best to leave and exit the ship in a more
traditional way like using the exit ramp.

Desc     Looking at the planet around you it apears ... well ... er ...
unfinished. Looks like some of the Omipresent beings that are in

Going down will take you to a slightly more playable planet ( even if
not entirely finished itself ;)

Desc     The main loung of the Serin Tocca is very similar to the pluogus even
though the ships are quite different. The large central hallway is flanked
by couches and chairs of various dimensions in an attempt to accomodate
passengers of all shapes and sizes. Some are even designed to be
adjustable although only manually. There apears to be no automatic
form-chairs at least in this room.

useless junk but a few items might be usefull to you. A small cash counter
is in one corner of the room but it is rarely used as a retail service
droid handles most transactions directly. There are several vending
machines along one wall offering many different varieties of packaged food
and drink.  There are however only a couple of tables in this part of ship
to sit down and eat.
