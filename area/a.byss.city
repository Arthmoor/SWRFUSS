walls glow duly in the light, the ship has been turned into a facility for
the recently rebuilt Byss. The shattered consoles erraticly shoot sparks
from the broken wires. Through the torn ceiling the low atmosphere of Byss
is visible to the naked eye. The dark viewscreen displays the rugged
landscape, you can see AT-ATs marching along loudly, you notice the large
amount of lightning coursing through the power core, pure energy from the
plasma storms above.
