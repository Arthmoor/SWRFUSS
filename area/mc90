Marines, the Z-105 Harpoon is only outclassed by the Slayn & Korpil B-Wing
of the New Republic. Built around the premise of long range being a must,
it has found a home as a fighter-bomber, strike craft, recon-scout,
escort, assault craft, and a trainer. The incorporation of a HOWL, or High
Ordinance Weapon Launcher, and the sensitivity and importance of its
sensors and targetting systems necessitates the use of a Weapons and
