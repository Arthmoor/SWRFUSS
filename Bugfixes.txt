SWR 1.0 FUSS

This is the SWR 1.0 code in it's last known release condition. All relevent
bugs that apply to SMAUG have been fixed in this version. Basically did this
to satisfy those who use the SWR code but have been clamoring for a fixed
version of it to download.

What's been done to this:

Removed all code warnings generated by GCC 3.x.
Removed the request pipe code that never worked.
Removed the remnants of the build interface code.
Applied all relevent fixes from Kevin London's list.
Applied all relevent fixes from Druid's list.
Applied all relevent fixes from Zylara's list.
Applied all relevent fixes from Darkoth's list.
Applied all relevent fixes from Sadiq's list.
Applied all relevent fixes from Rinthos' list.
Applied all relevent fixes from the MUD Planet bug list posts.
Applied the updated memory handling macros.
Backported the pcrename command from Smaug 1.4a.
Removed vestigial remains of the deity code.
Added a default Admin player for initial startup. Has no password. DELETE WHEN DONE USING IT.
Moved all help files from help2.are into help.are.
Crash bugs fixed in do_score.
Added Samson's color snippet to correct the flaws in the ANSI system.
Added Intermud-3 support.
Added AntiFreeze MD-1 support.
Added Cygwin support.

Tested error-free on the following platforms:

Redhat Linux 8.0, kernel 2.4.18-19.8.0, GCC 3.2 compiler
Cygwin 1.3.17-1, WinXP Pro w/ SP1, GCC 3.2 compiler, Cygwin crypt library installed.

NOTE: Any bugs specific to alterations made for SWR have NOT been fixed yet.
I do not know what those bugs may be, so if someone cares to enlighten me,
I'll be happy to include those fixes here.

One should also note that the way the areas are currently setup creates
dependency problems. There's no easy way to sort this out without massively
reworking the relationships between them all. So expect the boot logs to
be full of errors about objects, mobs, and rooms not existing.
